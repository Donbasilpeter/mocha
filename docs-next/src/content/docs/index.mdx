Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and in the browser, making asynchronous testing _straightforward_ and _fun_.
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
